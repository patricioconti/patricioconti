👀The first thing I am going to tell you is my main defect. I am not going to say that is being a perfectionist or that it is hard for me to delegate tasks. It would be too cliche.

Nope.

📱My main defect is that my experience in developing mobile applications with Android (Kotlin) is less than a year. That doesn't make me feel good or bad. It simply is.

If this is a problem, maybe you should stop reading here.

Otherwise I present myself:

💻⚙I'm Pato, an electronic engineer, I love composing music, singing and creating products to improve people's lives. My brain was washed, quality and efficiency are tattooed on my head.

How did that happen?

🏭🤖 🚙It happened because I worked for 10 years as a body engineer in a Toyota factory.
That’s why I am a fan of kaizen, simplicity, fundamentals and method. I led projects with very demanding deadlines that involved different automations: Kawasaki robots, automated vehicles, punching machines, presses and conveyor belts.


💻But I got tired of heavy machines and spending so much time locked up in the factory, and since I love programming, I decided to change my career and start training as an Android mobile app developer.

👜Oh, I also co-founded a business with my wife where we design and manufacture (custom) luxury leather handbags for the professional woman.

What?

Yes I know, very different from hard engineering and mobile applications. But that's me.
I am passionate about taking on challenges, have a wide variety of interests, and I’m driven by curiosity.

✨ I'm interested in putting hands on on android development projects using Kotlin.
